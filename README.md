# UMARV-CV-ScenePerception

A research and development platform for the University of Michigan's Autonomous Robotic Vehicle (UMARV) Computer Vision team to solve the understanding of a road scene.

## Models vs Algorithms

The models folder hosts all of our machine learning solutions, while the algorithms folder hosts our hard coded solutions. Each model/algorithm is seperated into its own folder and has its own unique ID.

## Scripts

The `src/scripts/` folder hosts our scripts which provide varrying functionalities from model/algorithm initialization, performance comparison, and dataset generation. To run them, right click on the script and select "Run Python File in Terminal".

## How To Interact With This Repository

1. Have git installed on your computer.
    - [git installation guide](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - [git introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_intro.asp?remote=github)
2. Have Python installed on your computer.
    - [Python Installation Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
3. Have these Python packages installed.
    - Open a terminal.
    - ```pip install opencv-python```
    - ```pip install torch```
    - ```pip install scikit-learn```
    - ```pip install matplotlib```
    - ```pip install gitpython```
    - ```pip install dropbox```
    - ```pip install tqdm```
    - ```pip install nbformat```
4. Request access to the ScenePerception GitHub repository from a team lead.
    - You must accept the invitation to the GitHub repository.
5. Setup the repository on your local machine.
    - On your Desktop, right click and select 'Open In Terminal'.
    - ```mkdir UMARV```
    - ```cd UMARV```
    - ```mkdir ScenePerception```
    - ```cd ScenePerception```
    - ```git clone https://github.com/AwrodHaghiTabrizi/UMARV-CV-ScenePerception.git .```
    - IMPORTANT: Replace your branch name in the end of the next 2 commands.
        - your_branch_name = "user/{your_name_with_no_spaces}"
        - Ex: Branch name for Awrod Haghi-Tabrizi = user/AwrodHaghiTabrizi
    - ```git checkout -b {your_branch_name}```
    - ```git push -u origin {your_branch_name}```
6. Open the project in VSCode.
    - Open VSCode.
    - Click File > Open Folder.
    - Open the `UMARV-CV-ScenePerception` folder.
        - Common mistake: Opening the `UMARV` folder or the `ScenePerception` folder.
        - IMPORTANT: Keep your working directory as `UMARV-CV-ScenePerception` when running scripts and notebooks.

### Repository Rules

- Full freedom to create/delete/edit code in your model/algorithm folder.
- Dont change any code in:
    - model/algorithm folders that dont belong to you (you can tell by the author name in the content/info.json or just by the model id itself).
    - `src/scripts/` (unless making global updates).
    - model_template/algorithm_tempalte (unless making global updates).
- Work in your own branch. <!-- Pull before every work session. Push after every work session. -->

## Environments

This repository allows development flexability to work in multiple environments, including:
    - Windows
    - Mac
    - Google Colab - [Working with Google Colab](https://github.com/AwrodHaghiTabrizi/UMARV-CV-ScenePerception/blob/users/AHT/docs/working_with_environments.md#google-colab)
    - LambdaLabs - [Working with LambdaLabs](https://github.com/AwrodHaghiTabrizi/UMARV-CV-ScenePerception/blob/users/AHT/docs/working_with_environments.md#lambdalabs)
    - Jetson (coming soon)

## Developing Models

1. Navigate to `src/scripts`.
2. Right click on either `create_model.py` or `create_copy_of_model.py`
    - `create_model.py` creates a new model from the template
    - `create_copy_of_model.py` creates a copy of a model using its model id
3. Click "Run Python File in Termainl".
4. Answer the prompts in the terminal.
5. Go through [Working With Models](https://github.com/AwrodHaghiTabrizi/UMARV-CV-ScenePerception/blob/users/AHT/docs/creating_models.md)

## Developing Algorithms

Functionality coming soon. For the time being, refer to the [LaneDetection repository](https://github.com/AwrodHaghiTabrizi/UMARV-CV-LaneDetection) for Algorithms support.
